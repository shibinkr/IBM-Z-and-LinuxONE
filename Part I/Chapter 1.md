## 1.1 IBM Z: The Enterprise Mainframe

IBM Z is the latest iteration of IBM's mainframe family, built on the **z/Architecture**. It offers:

- **High reliability and availability:** Often achieving “five-nines” uptime (99.999%).
- **Massive scalability:** Handles millions of transactions per second.
- **Advanced security features:** Including pervasive encryption, secure key management, and cryptographic co-processors.
- **Compatibility:** Supports decades of mainframe software and workloads.

IBM Z systems are used for critical workloads like banking, insurance, government services, and airline reservation systems, where uptime and data integrity are paramount.

## 1.2 IBM LinuxONE: Mainframe Meets Open Source

LinuxONE is IBM’s mainframe platform specifically optimized to run **Linux workloads**:

- **Enterprise-grade Linux:** Supports distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and Ubuntu for IBM Z.
- **Hybrid cloud integration:** Works seamlessly with private and public clouds.
- **Security:** Built-in encryption everywhere, allowing secure transactions for sensitive data.
- **Open ecosystem:** Supports containers, Kubernetes, and cloud-native applications on a mainframe platform.
- **Performance:** Leverages IBM Z hardware features for massive throughput and low latency.

LinuxONE allows enterprises to modernize mainframe workloads while maintaining the reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) characteristics of IBM Z.
